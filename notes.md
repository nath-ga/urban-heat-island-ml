## Conceptual understanding
- CSV provides point locations and UHI class labels
- Features are derived from spatial datasets (satellite imagery, building footprints)
- For each location, map-based values (e.g. vegetation, urban density) are extracted
- These values serve as input features for a classification model

## Project direction
- This project follows a competition-style workflow.
- Data sources, targets, and feature definitions are treated as given.
- Focus is on machine learning evaluation and baseline modeling.
